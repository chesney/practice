<h1>What is the surfing lifestyle?</h1>
<p>
East Coast, West Coast, Down Under, South Africa, Hawaii, the Caribbean, each spot has its own take on the
perfect surfing lifestyle. At Groundswell, we believe surfing lifestyles are lived by all those who dedicate
their lives to the pursuit of that perfect wave, or that beautiful, glassy day.
