About JSON :

JSON is purely meant to be a data description language. Per http://www.json.org, it is a "lightweight data-interchange format." - not a programming language.

Per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON, the "basic types" supported are:

Number (integer, real, or floating point)
String (double-quoted Unicode with backslash escaping)
Boolean (true and false)
Array (an ordered sequence of values, comma-separated and enclosed in square brackets)
Object (collection of key:value pairs, comma-separated and enclosed in curly braces)
null

====================================================
NO - You cannot add functions to JSON text object or
expect JSON to parse functions in a javascript object
