<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

  <p> Here's a long paragraph. The source file has no line breaks. Notice how the paragraph naturally wraps in the window. That behavior is part of the XHTML specification.
  </p>

  <p> Here's another long paragraph. This paragraph is wrapped in the
  source file. The paragraph in the source file is written as you would
  expect to see it: as a block with a comfortable amount of text per
  line, on several lines. Notice that this paragraph behaves the same
  way as the paragraph above.
